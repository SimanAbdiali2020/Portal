       <p>Hello there, <br /> My name is Siman and I am a Software Development and Testing student at the Puget Sound area. <br /> I am excited to share with you more about my self in this portal page. Stay tuned for something interesting. <br /> Thank you. </p>
       
       <p>I look forward to starting my internship which will be marked by a four weeks bootcamp training.<br />It will be a six months long internship period and I plan on making the most out of it. After that I intend on qualifying for a permanent employement position at the company where I will be working as an intern,and so I hope you will understand when I say, I will give it all my best. My goal is to advance in my career as a <b> <strong>Data Analyst.</strong></b></p>
       
       
       <p>I am skilled at using Microsoft services and tools, I am a good communicator, able to collaborate in a team setting and have the skills and capacity to implement critical thinking and creativity when problem solving. </p>
           
      <p>I am proud of the accomplishments I have made as a young professional. I have incredibly improved at communicating both in a professional and casual setting, able to give and receive feedback, and also gained the courage to be a public speaker. During my academic period in class, I have worked and completed a number of projects including program codes using programming languages such as python and JavaScript.<br /> Additionally, I recently had an outstanding score in a business class with my excel data analysis skills.</p>
